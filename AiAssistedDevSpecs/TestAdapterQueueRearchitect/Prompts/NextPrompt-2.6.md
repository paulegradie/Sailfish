### 🔄 Current Phase
**Phase 2: Framework Integration**
- **Progress**: 23 of 30 tasks completed
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS

### 🎯 Your Assignment
**Task 24: Create Queue Health Check**

**File to Create**: `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter/Queue/Implementation/QueueHealthCheck.cs`

**Description**: Monitor queue system health and performance metrics

**Dependencies**: Task 12 (completed ✅)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Monitor queue depth and processing rates
- Track processor performance and error rates
- Detect queue system degradation or failures
- Provide health status reporting for diagnostics
- Support configurable health check intervals and thresholds

## **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING** 🎯

### **Intercepting Queue Architecture**
This is **NOT** a side-channel queue. The queue **intercepts** framework publishing to enable batch processing:

```
CURRENT (Direct Framework Publishing):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)

TARGET (Intercepting Queue Architecture):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ TestCompletionQueueMessage → In-Memory Queue
    ↓ Queue Processors (Batching, Comparison, Analysis)
    ↓ Enhanced FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification(s)
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)
```

### **Key Architectural Principles**:
1. **NO direct framework publishing** from TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20 ✅ COMPLETED)
2. **Queue processors are responsible** for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
3. **Batching enables cross-test-case analysis** before framework reporting
4. **Enhanced results** with comparison data sent to framework
5. **Fallback mechanism** ensures tests never hang if queue fails

### **Why This Architecture?**
- **Cross-Test-Case Analysis**: Compare multiple test methods within a single test run
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tests for statistical analysis
- **Enhanced Results**: Enrich test results with comparison rankings and insights
- **Framework Integration**: Results appear normally in VS Test Platform with enhanced data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Ensure thread-safety where required
- Use Sailfish.Logging.ILogger for logging consistency

### Integration Points
- **Current Notification System**: Uses MediatR with handlers in `Handlers/TestCaseEvents/`
- **DI Container**: Autofac registration in `Registrations/TestAdapterRegistrations.cs`
- **Configuration**: Sailfish run settings system
- **Testing**: Test project at `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Tests.TestAdapter`

### Key Existing Components to Understand
- `TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler.cs` - **MODIFIED** in Task 20 - now uses queue
- `FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler.cs` - Final result reporting (unchanged)
- `TestAdapterRegistrations.cs` - DI container setup (completed in Task 19)
- `TestExecutor.cs` - **MODIFIED** in Task 22 - now manages queue lifecycle
- `BatchTimeoutHandler.cs` - **NEW** in Task 23 - monitors batch timeouts

## Specific Instructions for This Task

### Step-by-Step Approach

   - Implement health metrics collection (queue depth, processing rates, error rates)
   - Add health status reporting and degradation detection
   - Support configurable health check intervals and thresholds
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging

5. **⚙️ IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING** according to acceptance criteria

6. **🧪 BUILD AND VALIDATE** to ensure all changes work correctly

### Critical Implementation Requirements
Based on the intercepting architecture, you must:

1. **Health Monitoring**: Monitor queue depth, processing rates, and system performance
2. **Error Tracking**: Track processor performance and error rates across the system
3. **Degradation Detection**: Detect queue system degradation or failures automatically
4. **Status Reporting**: Provide health status reporting for diagnostics and troubleshooting
5. **Configuration**: Support configurable health check intervals and thresholds
6. **Integration**: Ensure proper coordination with existing queue infrastructure

## Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do not break existing functionality
- All queue features must be optional and configurable
- Existing test execution must work unchanged if queue is disabled
- Maintain all existing public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- No performance regression in existing test execution
- Health check operations should be efficient and non-blocking
- Proper disposal of resources and memory management
- Consider thread pool usage and async/await best practices

### Future Integration Points
- This enables proper health monitoring for queue system reliability
- Must support diagnostic reporting for troubleshooting queue issues
- Should enable configuration-driven health monitoring behavior
- Must integrate with existing queue infrastructure and logging
