### 🔄 Current Phase
**Phase 2: Framework Integration**
- **Progress**: 22 of 30 tasks completed
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS

### 🎯 Your Assignment
**Task 23: Create Batch Timeout Handler**

**File to Create**: `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter/Queue/Implementation/BatchTimeoutHandler.cs`

**Description**: Handle timeout scenarios for incomplete test case batches

**Dependencies**: Task 16 (completed ✅)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Monitor batch completion timeouts
- Process incomplete batches when timeout expires
- Publish framework notifications for timed-out batches
- Configurable timeout values per batch type
- Proper logging and error reporting for timeout scenarios

## **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING** 🎯

### **Intercepting Queue Architecture**
This is **NOT** a side-channel queue. The queue **intercepts** framework publishing to enable batch processing:

```
CURRENT (Direct Framework Publishing):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)

TARGET (Intercepting Queue Architecture):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ TestCompletionQueueMessage → In-Memory Queue
    ↓ Queue Processors (Batching, Comparison, Analysis)
    ↓ Enhanced FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification(s)
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)
```

### **Key Architectural Principles**:
1. **NO direct framework publishing** from TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20 ✅ COMPLETED)
2. **Queue processors are responsible** for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
3. **Batching enables cross-test-case analysis** before framework reporting
4. **Enhanced results** with comparison data sent to framework
5. **Fallback mechanism** ensures tests never hang if queue fails

### **Why This Architecture?**
- **Cross-Test-Case Analysis**: Compare multiple test methods within a single test run
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tests for statistical analysis
- **Enhanced Results**: Enrich test results with comparison rankings and insights
- **Framework Integration**: Results appear normally in VS Test Platform with enhanced data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Ensure thread-safety where required
- Use Sailfish.Logging.ILogger for logging consistency

### Integration Points
- **Current Notification System**: Uses MediatR with handlers in `Handlers/TestCaseEvents/`
- **DI Container**: Autofac registration in `Registrations/TestAdapterRegistrations.cs`
- **Configuration**: Sailfish run settings system
- **Testing**: Test project at `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Tests.TestAdapter`

### Key Existing Components to Understand
- `TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler.cs` - **MODIFIED** in Task 20 - now uses queue
- `FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler.cs` - Final result reporting (unchanged)
- `TestAdapterRegistrations.cs` - DI container setup (completed in Task 19)
- `TestExecutor.cs` - **MODIFIED** in Task 22 - now manages queue lifecycle

## Specific Instructions for This Task

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **📖 READ ALL DOCUMENTATION FIRST** (critical for understanding the architecture)

2. **🔍 UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - Examine the TestCaseBatchingService implementation (Task 16)
   - Understand batch completion detection and timeout handling
   - Review the QueueConfiguration timeout settings
   - Understand how batches are processed when they timeout

3. **🔧 EXAMINE THE QUEUE INFRASTRUCTURE**:
   - Review the queue processor base class and framework publishing processor
   - Understand how processors are registered and executed
   - Review the queue manager and consumer service implementations

4. **📁 CREATE THE BATCH TIMEOUT HANDLER**:
   - Create BatchTimeoutHandler.cs that monitors batch timeouts
   - Implement timeout detection for incomplete batches
   - Add logic to process timed-out batches and publish framework notifications
   - Support configurable timeout values per batch type
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging

5. **⚙️ IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING** according to acceptance criteria

6. **🧪 BUILD AND VALIDATE** to ensure all changes work correctly

### Critical Implementation Requirements
Based on the intercepting architecture, you must:

1. **Timeout Monitoring**: Monitor batch completion timeouts using configuration settings
2. **Incomplete Batch Processing**: Process batches that don't complete within timeout
3. **Framework Publishing**: Publish framework notifications for timed-out batches
4. **Configurable Timeouts**: Support different timeout values per batch type
5. **Error Handling**: Robust logging and error reporting for timeout scenarios
6. **Integration**: Ensure proper coordination with existing batching service

## Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do not break existing functionality
- All queue features must be optional and configurable
- Existing test execution must work unchanged if queue is disabled
- Maintain all existing public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- No performance regression in existing test execution
- Timeout operations should be efficient and non-blocking
- Proper disposal of resources and memory management
- Consider thread pool usage and async/await best practices

### Future Integration Points
- This enables proper timeout handling for batch processing
- Must support cross-test-case analysis with timeout scenarios
- Should enable configuration-driven timeout behavior
- Must integrate with existing queue infrastructure

## Validation Steps
After completing your task:

1. **Build the project** - Ensure no compilation errors
2. **Run existing tests** - Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. **Test timeout handling** - Verify timeout scenarios work correctly
4. **Check integration** - Ensure proper coordination with batching service
