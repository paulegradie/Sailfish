**⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT READING THESE FILES FIRST ⚠️**

## Project Context
You are implementing an **intercepting queue architecture** for the Sailfish Test Adapter to enable batch processing and cross-test-case analysis before results reach the VS Test Platform. This is a **FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE** from the original side-channel approach.

## Repository Information
- **Repository Root**: G:/code/Sailfish
- **Working Directory**: G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter
- **Branch**: pg/rearch-3
- **Project**: Sailfish.TestAdapter (.NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0)

## Current Project Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Task 1**: Create Queue Message Contract ✅ Completed - TestCompletionQueueMessage.cs created with all required properties, JSON serialization, and comprehensive XML documentation

### 🔄 Current Phase
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- **Progress**: 1 of 18 tasks completed
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### 🎯 Your Assignment
**Task 2: Create Queue Publisher Interface**

**File to Create**: `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter/Queue/Contracts/ITestCompletionQueuePublisher.cs`

**Description**: Define the interface for publishing test completion messages to the queue system

**Dependencies**: Task 1 (✅ Completed)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define ITestCompletionQueuePublisher interface
- Include PublishTestCompletion async method
- Add proper cancellation token support
- Include XML documentation for all methods
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions

## **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING** 🎯

### **Intercepting Queue Architecture**
This is **NOT** a side-channel queue. The queue **intercepts** framework publishing to enable batch processing:

```
CURRENT (Direct Framework Publishing):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)

TARGET (Intercepting Queue Architecture):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ TestCompletionQueueMessage → In-Memory Queue
    ↓ Queue Processors (Batching, Comparison, Analysis)
    ↓ Enhanced FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification(s)
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)
```

### **Key Architectural Principles**:
1. **NO direct framework publishing** from TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20)
2. **Queue processors are responsible** for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
3. **Batching enables cross-test-case analysis** before framework reporting
4. **Enhanced results** with comparison data sent to framework
5. **Fallback mechanism** ensures tests never hang if queue fails

### **Why This Architecture?**
- **Cross-Test-Case Analysis**: Compare multiple test methods within a single test run
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tests for statistical analysis
- **Enhanced Results**: Enrich test results with comparison rankings and insights
- **Framework Integration**: Results appear normally in VS Test Platform with enhanced data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Ensure thread-safety where required
- Use System.Text.Json for serialization consistency

### Integration Points
- **Current Notification System**: Uses MediatR with handlers in `Handlers/TestCaseEvents/`
- **DI Container**: Autofac registration in `Registrations/TestAdapterRegistrations.cs`
- **Configuration**: Sailfish run settings system
- **Testing**: Test project at `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Tests.TestAdapter`

### Key Existing Components to Understand
- `TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler.cs` - **WILL BE MODIFIED** in Task 20 to use queue
- `FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler.cs` - Final result reporting (unchanged)
- `TestAdapterRegistrations.cs` - DI container setup
- `TestExecutor.cs` - Test execution lifecycle

## Specific Instructions for This Task

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **📖 READ ALL DOCUMENTATION FIRST** (critical for understanding the architecture)

2. **🔍 UNDERSTAND THE PUBLISHER INTERFACE**:
   - Review Task 2 in the specification for detailed requirements
   - Understand how this interface will be used by notification handlers
   - Consider async/await patterns and cancellation support

3. **🔧 EXAMINE EXISTING CODE**:
   - Look at existing interfaces in the project for patterns
   - Review how MediatR publishers work in the current system
   - Study async interface patterns in the Sailfish codebase

4. **📁 CREATE THE INTERFACE FILE** in the Queue/Contracts directory

5. **⚙️ IMPLEMENT THE INTERFACE** according to acceptance criteria

6. **🧪 BUILD AND VALIDATE** to ensure no compilation errors

```

### Interface Requirements
Based on the intercepting architecture, the interface must include:

1. **PublishTestCompletion** method that accepts TestCompletionQueueMessage
2. **Async/await support** for non-blocking queue operations
3. **CancellationToken support** for proper cancellation handling
4. **Return Task** for async operations
5. **Comprehensive XML documentation** explaining the interface purpose

## Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do not break existing functionality
- All queue features must be optional and configurable
- Existing test execution must work unchanged if queue is disabled
- Maintain all existing public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- Interface should support async operations to avoid blocking
- Consider memory usage for message publishing scenarios
- Use appropriate async patterns for queue operations
- Design for high-throughput test execution scenarios

### Future Integration Points
- Interface will be implemented by queue publisher service (Task 6)
- Will be used by TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20)
- Must support batching service integration (Task 16)
- Configuration system will control publisher behavior (Tasks 43-52)
