### 🔄 Current Phase
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- **Progress**: 16 of 18 tasks completed
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### 🎯 Your Assignment
**Task 17: Create Framework Publishing Queue Processor**

**File to Create**: `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter/Queue/Processors/FrameworkPublishingProcessor.cs`

**Description**: Queue processor responsible for publishing results to VS Test Platform

**Dependencies**: Tasks 7, 16 (both completed ✅)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Extends TestCompletionQueueProcessorBase
- Inject IMediator for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
- Handle both individual and batch test results
- Maintain original framework contract and timing
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Support for enhanced test results with comparison data
- Comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Integration with existing Sailfish logging infrastructure (ILogger)
- Support for async/await patterns
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent test execution
- Memory-efficient processing and resource management

## **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING** 🎯

### **Intercepting Queue Architecture**
This is **NOT** a side-channel queue. The queue **intercepts** framework publishing to enable batch processing:

```
CURRENT (Direct Framework Publishing):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)

TARGET (Intercepting Queue Architecture):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ TestCompletionQueueMessage → In-Memory Queue
    ↓ Queue Processors (Batching, Comparison, Analysis)
    ↓ Enhanced FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification(s)
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)
```

### **Key Architectural Principles**:
1. **NO direct framework publishing** from TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20)
2. **Queue processors are responsible** for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
3. **Batching enables cross-test-case analysis** before framework reporting
4. **Enhanced results** with comparison data sent to framework
5. **Fallback mechanism** ensures tests never hang if queue fails

### **Why This Architecture?**
- **Cross-Test-Case Analysis**: Compare multiple test methods within a single test run
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tests for statistical analysis
- **Enhanced Results**: Enrich test results with comparison rankings and insights
- **Framework Integration**: Results appear normally in VS Test Platform with enhanced data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Ensure thread-safety where required
- Use Sailfish.Logging.ILogger for logging consistency

### Integration Points
- **Current Notification System**: Uses MediatR with handlers in `Handlers/TestCaseEvents/`
- **DI Container**: Autofac registration in `Registrations/TestAdapterRegistrations.cs`
- **Configuration**: Sailfish run settings system
- **Testing**: Test project at `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Tests.TestAdapter`

### Key Existing Components to Understand
- `TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler.cs` - **WILL BE MODIFIED** in Task 20 to use queue
- `FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler.cs` - Final result reporting (unchanged)
- `TestAdapterRegistrations.cs` - DI container setup
- `TestExecutor.cs` - Test execution lifecycle

## Specific Instructions for This Task

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **📖 READ ALL DOCUMENTATION FIRST** (critical for understanding the architecture)

2. **🔍 UNDERSTAND THE FRAMEWORK PUBLISHING PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Review Task 17 in the specification for detailed requirements
   - Understand how the processor should publish FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
   - Study the existing TestCompletionQueueProcessorBase pattern
   - Review MediatR integration patterns in the codebase
   - Understand how to maintain framework contract and timing

3. **🔧 EXAMINE EXISTING CODE**:
   - Look at the TestCompletionQueueProcessorBase class (Task 7)
   - Review existing notification handlers in Handlers/TestCaseEvents/
   - Study the FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification structure
   - Understand MediatR usage patterns in the codebase
   - Review the TestCaseBatchingService for batch processing patterns

4. **📁 CREATE THE FRAMEWORK PUBLISHING PROCESSOR**

5. **⚙️ IMPLEMENT THE PROCESSOR** according to acceptance criteria

6. **🧪 BUILD AND VALIDATE** to ensure no compilation errors

### Implementation Requirements
Based on the intercepting architecture, the framework publishing processor implementation must include:

1. **Extends TestCompletionQueueProcessorBase** - inherit from the base processor class
2. **Inject IMediator for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification** - use MediatR for framework publishing
3. **Handle both individual and batch test results** - support single tests and batched results
4. **Maintain original framework contract and timing** - ensure VS Test Platform compatibility
5. **Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms** - robust error handling with fallback options
6. **Support for enhanced test results with comparison data** - enrich results before framework publishing
7. **Comprehensive XML documentation** - document all public methods and classes
8. **Integration with Sailfish.Logging.ILogger** - consistent logging patterns
9. **Support for async/await patterns** - maintain asynchronous operation support
10. **Thread-safe operations** - handle concurrent test execution scenarios
11. **Memory-efficient processing** - optimize for performance and resource usage

## Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do not break existing functionality
- All queue features must be optional and configurable
- Existing test execution must work unchanged if queue is disabled
- Maintain all existing public APIs

### Performance Considerations

- Consider performance impact of framework publishing operations
- Design for high-throughput test execution scenarios
- Avoid complex operations that impact test execution performance
