title: Quick Start Guide
---

Get up and running with Sailfish in just a few minutes! This guide will walk you through creating your first performance test.

{% info-callout title="Prerequisites" %}
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- .NET 6.0 or later installed
- A C# development environment (Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider)
- Basic familiarity with C# and unit testing
{% /info-callout %}

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Test Project

{% success-callout title="Quick Setup" %}
Create a new class library project and install the Sailfish Test Adapter for full IDE integration.
{% /success-callout %}

```bash
# Create a new test project
dotnet new classlib -n MyApp.PerformanceTests
cd MyApp.PerformanceTests

# Install the Sailfish Test Adapter
dotnet add package Sailfish.TestAdapter
```

{% tip-callout title="IDE Integration" %}
The Test Adapter allows you to run Sailfish tests directly from your IDE, just like xUnit or NUnit tests.
{% /tip-callout %}

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Write Your First Performance Test

{% code-callout title="Simple and Powerful" %}
Create a new test class with the `[Sailfish]` attribute - it's that easy to get started!
{% /code-callout %}

```csharp
using Sailfish.Attributes;

[Sailfish]
public class Example
{
    private readonly IClient client;

    [SailfishVariable(1, 10)]
    public int N { get; set; }

    public Example(IClient client)
    {
        this.client = client;
    }

    [SailfishMethod]
    public async Task TestMethod(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await client.Get("/api", ct);
    }
}
```

{% info-callout title="Understanding the Code" %}
- `[Sailfish]` marks the class as a performance test
- `[SailfishVariable]` creates test variations with different values
- `[SailfishMethod]` marks the method to be performance tested
{% /info-callout %}

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Register Dependencies (Optional)

{% tip-callout title="Dependency Injection" %}
If your tests need dependencies, implement `IProvideARegistrationCallback` to register them with the container.
{% /tip-callout %}

```csharp
public class RegistrationProvider : IProvideARegistrationCallback
{
    public async Task RegisterAsync(
        ContainerBuilder builder,
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
       var typeInstance = await MyClientFactory.Create(ct);
       builder.Register(_ => typeInstance).As<IClient>();
    }
}
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your Performance Tests

{% success-callout title="Multiple Ways to Run" %}
Execute your tests using your preferred test runner - command line, IDE, or CI/CD pipeline.
{% /success-callout %}

```bash
# Run tests from command line
dotnet test

# Or run from your IDE's test explorer
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ View Your Results

{% info-callout title="Rich Output Formats" %}
Sailfish provides statistical analysis including mean execution time, standard deviation, and outlier detection across multiple output formats.
{% /info-callout %}

**Output Options:**
- **Console Output**: Immediate feedback in your terminal
- **Tracking Files**: Detailed data for analysis and comparison
- **Custom Formats**: Export to CSV, Markdown, or custom formats
