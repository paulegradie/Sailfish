### 🔄 Current Phase
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- **Progress**: 8 of 18 tasks completed
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### 🎯 Your Assignment
**Task 9: Create Queue Configuration Model**

**File to Create**: `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Sailfish.TestAdapter/Queue/Configuration/QueueConfiguration.cs`

**Description**: Configuration model for in-memory queue settings

**Dependencies**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define QueueConfiguration class for in-memory queue settings
- Include queue capacity, processor settings, enablement flags
- Default values optimized for in-memory operations
- Simple configuration model - no complex persistence settings needed
- Comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Integration with existing Sailfish logging infrastructure (ILogger)
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent execution scenarios

## **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING** 🎯

### **Intercepting Queue Architecture**
This is **NOT** a side-channel queue. The queue **intercepts** framework publishing to enable batch processing:

```
CURRENT (Direct Framework Publishing):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)

TARGET (Intercepting Queue Architecture):
TestCaseCompletedNotification 
    ↓ (TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler)
    ↓ TestCompletionQueueMessage → In-Memory Queue
    ↓ Queue Processors (Batching, Comparison, Analysis)
    ↓ Enhanced FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification(s)
    ↓ (FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler)  
    ↓ VS Test Platform (ITestFrameworkWriter)
```

### **Key Architectural Principles**:
1. **NO direct framework publishing** from TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler (Task 20)
2. **Queue processors are responsible** for publishing FrameworkTestCaseEndNotification
3. **Batching enables cross-test-case analysis** before framework reporting
4. **Enhanced results** with comparison data sent to framework
5. **Fallback mechanism** ensures tests never hang if queue fails

### **Why This Architecture?**
- **Cross-Test-Case Analysis**: Compare multiple test methods within a single test run
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tests for statistical analysis
- **Enhanced Results**: Enrich test results with comparison rankings and insights
- **Framework Integration**: Results appear normally in VS Test Platform with enhanced data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing Sailfish coding conventions
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Ensure thread-safety where required
- Use System.Text.Json for serialization consistency

### Integration Points
- **Current Notification System**: Uses MediatR with handlers in `Handlers/TestCaseEvents/`
- **DI Container**: Autofac registration in `Registrations/TestAdapterRegistrations.cs`
- **Configuration**: Sailfish run settings system
- **Testing**: Test project at `G:/code/Sailfish/source/Tests.TestAdapter`

### Key Existing Components to Understand
- `TestCaseCompletedNotificationHandler.cs` - **WILL BE MODIFIED** in Task 20 to use queue
- `FrameworkTestCaseEndNotificationHandler.cs` - Final result reporting (unchanged)
- `TestAdapterRegistrations.cs` - DI container setup
- `TestExecutor.cs` - Test execution lifecycle

## Specific Instructions for This Task

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **📖 READ ALL DOCUMENTATION FIRST** (critical for understanding the architecture)

2. **🔍 UNDERSTAND THE QUEUE CONFIGURATION MODEL IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - Review Task 9 in the specification for detailed requirements
   - Understand how the configuration model will control queue behavior
   - Consider configuration patterns used in existing Sailfish codebase

3. **🔧 EXAMINE EXISTING CODE**:
   - Look at the completed Tasks 1-8 for patterns and conventions
   - Review existing configuration patterns in the Sailfish.TestAdapter project
   - Study the TestSettingsParser directory for configuration examples
   - Understand configuration patterns in the existing Sailfish codebase

4. **📁 CREATE THE CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY** if it doesn't exist: Queue/Configuration/

5. **⚙️ IMPLEMENT THE CONFIGURATION MODEL** according to acceptance criteria

6. **🧪 BUILD AND VALIDATE** to ensure no compilation errors

```

### Implementation Requirements
Based on the intercepting architecture, the configuration model must include:

1. **Queue enablement flags** to control whether queue processing is active
2. **Queue capacity settings** for in-memory queue size limits
3. **Processor configuration** for controlling which processors are enabled
4. **Timeout settings** for queue operations and processor execution
5. **Retry configuration** for failed queue operations
6. **Default values** optimized for in-memory operations
7. **Comprehensive XML documentation** explaining all configuration options

## Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Do not break existing functionality
- All queue features must be optional and configurable
- Existing test execution must work unchanged if queue is disabled
- Maintain all existing public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- Configuration should be lightweight and efficient
- Consider memory usage for configuration storage
- Design for high-throughput test execution scenarios
- Avoid complex configuration that impacts performance

### Future Integration Points
- Configuration will be loaded by configuration loader (Task 26)
- Will be used by queue manager (Task 12)
- Will be registered in DI container (Task 19)
- Will be extended by processor configuration (Task 38)

## Validation Steps
After completing your task:

1. **Build the project** - Ensure no compilation errors
2. **Run existing tests** - Verify no regressions
3. **Validate implementation** - Ensure all configuration properties are defined
4. **Check documentation** - Verify XML documentation is comprehensive
5. **Review integration points** - Ensure configuration supports future tasks
