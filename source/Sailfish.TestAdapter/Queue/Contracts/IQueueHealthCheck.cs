/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for a service that monitors the health and performance of the queue system.
/// This interface is part of the intercepting queue architecture that enables comprehensive monitoring
/// and diagnostics of queue operations, processing rates, and system performance.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The IQueueHealthCheck provides real-time monitoring capabilities for the queue infrastructure,
/// including queue depth monitoring, processing rate tracking, error rate analysis, and system
/// degradation detection. This enables proactive identification of performance issues and system
/// failures before they impact test execution.
/// 
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Monitor queue operational status and performance metrics
/// - Track processing rates and identify performance bottlenecks
/// - Detect error patterns and system degradation scenarios
/// - Provide health status reporting for diagnostics and alerting
/// - Support configurable monitoring intervals and alert thresholds
/// - Enable proactive monitoring and early warning systems
/// 
/// The health check service operates as a background monitoring service that periodically
/// evaluates queue system health and provides both on-demand status queries and event-driven
/// notifications when health status changes occur.
/// 
/// Thread Safety:
/// All methods in this interface must be thread-safe and support concurrent access from
/// multiple threads. Implementations should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
/// to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.
/// 
/// Integration:
/// This service integrates with the existing queue infrastructure components including
/// TestCompletionQueueManager, queue consumers, and batch processing services to provide
/// comprehensive system monitoring capabilities.
/// </remarks>
