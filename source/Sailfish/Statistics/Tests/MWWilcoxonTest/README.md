# Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
**Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the median.**

* Note - this test is NOT the same as the WilcoxonSignedRankTest NOR the WilcoxonTest

## Usage

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used when comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test). It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student's t-test, t-test for matched pairs, or the t-test for dependent samples when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is not the same as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, although both are nonparametric and involve summation of ranks.
