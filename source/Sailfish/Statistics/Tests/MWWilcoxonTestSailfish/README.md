# MannWhitneyWilcoxonTest
**Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for unpaired samples**

### Aliases
Mann–Whitney U test also called the 
 - Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW)
 - Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
 - Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test)

## Usage
Note - this test is NOT the same as the Two Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test 

## Example

```csharp
// Claustrophobia test scores for people treated with treatment A
double[] sample1 = { 4.6, 4.7, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.8, 6.1, 6.5, 6.5, 7.2 };

// Claustrophobia test scores for people treated with treatment B
double[] sample2 = { 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.7, 8.0, 8.1 };

// Create a new Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon's test to compare the two samples
MannWhitneyWilcoxonTest test = new MannWhitneyWilcoxonTest(sample1, sample2,
  TwoSampleHypothesis.FirstValueIsSmallerThanSecond);

double sum1 = test.RankSum1; //  96.5
double sum2 = test.RankSum2; // 134.5

double statistic1 = test.Statistic1; // 79.5
double statistic2 = test.Statistic2; // 30.5

double pvalue = test.PValue; // 0.043834132843420748

// Check if the test was significant
bool significant = test.Significant; // true
```



It has greater efficiency than the t-test on non-normal distributions, such as a mixture of normal distributions, and it is nearly as efficient as the t-test on normal distributions.
